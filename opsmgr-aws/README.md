# MongoDB Ops Manager: AWS

A collection of scripts and utilities to install Ops Manager (a single-node Ops Manager demo instance) and a set of agent worker nodes in AWS using EC2 RHEL images.

You can provision the EC2 instances any way you want - have a look [here](https://github.com/janosj/utilities/tree/main/provision-aws-hardware) for one option.
