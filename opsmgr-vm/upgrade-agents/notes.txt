As part of the Ops Manager upgrade process, the agents have to be upgraded.
This is typically done via the Ops Manager UI (a simple click of the button). 
But here, we have to incorporate the new agent into the Docker containers
(all changes are lost when the containers are restarted).

Paul Done’s build notes for the VM has the procedure to build the containers. 
With this repo copied into the VM, run build-agent.sh (as root).
Ops Manager has to be running, because the script reaches out to it for the new agent.

To verify, use the Ops Manager UI : The server view shows what version of the agents 
are running on each host, which should match the version that’s available in 
Agents > Downloads.

The Dockerfile doesn't include any agent config file. 
Everything gets passed in to the run command (in start_containers.ssh)

Docker volumes map to /var/lib/docker/volumes on host. 
That directory builds up over time. 
Use docker volume prune to eliminate unused volumes (not belonging to any containers). 
Last I ran this it reclaimed 6GB of space.
