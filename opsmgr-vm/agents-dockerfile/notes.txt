JJanos Notes

Re-ran these to upgrade the version of the automation agents in the containers.
This is documented in Paul Done's notes.

The Dockerfile doesn't include any agent config file. Everything gets passed in to the run command (in start_containers.ssh)

Docker volumes map to /var/lib/docker/volumes on host. 
That directory builds up over time. 
Use docker volume prune to eliminate unused volumes (not belonging to any containers). 
Last I ran this it reclaimed 6GB of space.
