# Show that the MongoDB data files are stored as cleartext 
# unless you enable encryption-at-rest.

# This assumes you have some data loaded into the database.
# These sample searches work against the data loaded 
# as part of the profiling and performance advice demos.

# As sudo:
ls /data
find /data -name "collection*.wt" | xargs strings | grep "disaster"

# Or
find /data -name "collection*.wt" | xargs strings | grep "Chernobyl"

# Results may vary from deployment to deployment.
# Use whatever shows best.
# Best to run these queries prior to demo, to verify results.
